## A `revealjs` quarto template

This template combines some elements from the
[quarto-revealjs-clean](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean)
template and the [`solarized`
theme](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html).

The fonts used are "Roboto Slab" (for headings) and "Lato" (for the body), both
taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The `my-theme.scss` file allows for easily changing the colors and fonts used
with the theme.

To try it out, it suffices to run:
```
quarto use lcgodoy/quarto-solarclean
```
